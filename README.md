# DDPD-hyperelastic-experiments
# Experimental Tensile Data for Hyperelastic Specimens (DDPD Study)

This repository provides the experimental datasets used in the manuscript:

*A Novel Peridynamics Framework Incorporating Data-Driven Constitutive Models：Modeling Large Deformation and Asymmetric Damage in Heterogeneous Hyperelastic Materials*  

The data support constitutive identification and validation of the proposed data-driven peridynamics (DDPD) framework.
